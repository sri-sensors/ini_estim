# Intelligent Neural Interface EStim

Code for optimizing electrical stimulation (EStim) of nerve fibers using mutual information based on MINE (mutual 
information neural estimation). The interfaces optimization used CAD models of several implanted electrode arrays and 
motion data from several research prosthetic devices. 

For developers:
--------------
Install by running (in setup.py folder)
> python -m pip install -e .

Then you can import in python:

    import ini_estim
   
or, for example:

    from ini_estim import spontaneous
